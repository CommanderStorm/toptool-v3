# Run for development

By default Django uses a SQLite database that can be generated using the
following command inside the project directory:

    python manage.py migrate

Then a superuser should be created:

    python manage.py createsuperuser

Now you can start the webserver for development:

    python manage.py runserver

Now visit http://localhost:8000 with your browser.

# Translation

Update the .po files with:

    python manage.py makemessages -l de

Then edit the .po files, e.g. locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/django.po.
poedit is an excellent GUI for this!

Finally create the .mo files with the new translations:

    python manage.py compilemessages
